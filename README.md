Ever wanted to share some kind of a opinion with someone, but you weren't sure they would accept, or share it? This website was made just for that!

## How do I start?

There are two ways you can get an opinion chart to a friend, by making one, or using an existing one. To make your own, go to the create page and fill out the required fields. To use an existing one, go to the session page to create a session. You can search for one on the search page.

A chart is a list of checkmarks that are labeled with opinions. To make one, go to the creation page and fill out a form. To add more checks, hit the "Add More" button
