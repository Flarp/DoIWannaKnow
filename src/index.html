      <h1>Do I Wanna Know?</h1>
      <br><br>
      <p>Ever wanted to share some kind of a opinion with someone, but you weren't sure they would accept, or share it? This website was made just for that! </p>
      <br>
      <h2>How do I start?</h2>
      <p>There are two ways you can get an opinion chart to a friend, by making one, or using an existing one. To make your own, click <a href="/create">here</a> and fill out the required fields. To use an existing one, click <a href="/session">here</a> to create a session. You can search for one <a href="/search">here</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>What is a chart? How do I make one?</h2>
      <p>A chart is a list of checkmarks that are labeled with opinions. To make one, go to the creation page and fill out a form. To add more checks, hit the "Add More" button. There is a limit to how big a chart can be. A chart has a maximum of 63 opinions, and each opinion has a maximum of 127 bytes. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/ch08-02-strings.html#internal-representation">(Bytes, not characters.)</a></p>
      <br>
      <h2>What is a session? How do I make one?</h2>
      <p>A session is a running version of a chart. Two users fill it out and the results of what they have in common are returned. To make one, go to the session creation page and fill out the required fields.</p>
